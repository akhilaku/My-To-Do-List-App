# My To-Do-List Application

**I created this application by learning Kotlin Programming language in 30-Days as a part of 30-Days of Kotlin. 30-Days of Kotlin with Google Developers is an initiative to improve our understanding of Kotlin and to apply it in real projects using Google resources from May-07 to June-07.
This is a To-Do-List Application created on Android Studios using Kotlin programming language**

### What is a To-Do-List Application?

We all know that one of the toughest skills for majority of the people in the world is mastering to stay organized every day. That is why we need to use To-Do-List Application. The To-Do-List App works well for storing the list of things that we should do everyday without forgetting. For doing the Daily routines without forgetting. We can store all the things we want to do as items in a list.

### The Specific Description of the Application is given in below:

1. The application must able to store the items or entries in a list, we use **"ListView"** for this.

1. We must be able to take the input from the users to add the items in the lists, So here we use the **"EditText"** to take the inputs from the user and we use the **"Add"** button to add the items or entries to the list.

1. In the same way, we should be able to delete the items from the list. We have to select a particular item and want to delete it using button **"Delete"**, that is to remove the item from the list using **Kotlin Programming.**
 
1. And we have to include the **List View Checkbox** and make it more functional using **Kotlin Program.**

1. We should be able to clear the entire list using a **"Clear"** button.

**The buttons such as "Add", "Delete" and "Clear" perform the desired operations only if we do the required coding(Programming).**
